 The answer correctly calculated $2^{(p-1)/2}$ for primes 3 $\leq$ p $<$ 20.
 
 The conjecture was that "We always get the values $\pm1$".
 The proof provided was correct, though not complete. The steps given were vauge, and it was not in the format of a formal proof. It was did not cite Fremat's Little Theroem, though it was referenced, and it did not completely show the algebra to complete the proof to fruition. We were left with "Therefore $2^{(p-1)/2} \equiv \pm1$ (mod p)", and while it is correct, it does not fully show the steps to complete the proof.
